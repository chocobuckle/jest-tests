# Jasmine/BDD

This project demonstrates my ability to write effective tests against a pre-existing application using the Jasmine BDD framework. Submitted as a project for the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree program.

## Getting Started

Just [download](https://github.com/chocobuckle/jasmine-bdd/archive/master.zip) the repository, unzip, then click on index.html to open the page in your default browser. The Jasmine spec runner will be shown at the bottom of the page, listing all passed specs. To view the code written for the specs themselves, open 'feedreader.js', located at './jasmine/spec/'.
